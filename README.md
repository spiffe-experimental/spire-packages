# spire-packages

This repo just contains some workflows that create alternative packages for spire-agent for rpm and apt users. 

The server is not included. It needs to be HA, and the best way to achieve this is with Kubernetes and a Helm chart for easy installation. So an RPM would not be very helpful for most users. 

# WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL
These packages are not yet ready for production use.
